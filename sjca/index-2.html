            The weekly meetings always provided motivation and inspiration to
            ‘keep moving.’ The program stressed the importance of communicating
            to a potential employer how I can help them, and not the other way
            around. - Ty

            Your assistance with resume tips, interview questions and follow
            through allowed me to gain the confidence needed while interviewing
            with prospective employers. Not only did the team provide me with
            the technical aspects of the job search, but the spiritual support
            was something for which I will be forever grateful. Thanks again! -
